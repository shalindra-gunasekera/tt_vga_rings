## How it works

The ring display uses the ui_in byte to set the speed and colours present in the rings. The bit description enables the following when enabled:

ui_in[1:0] - speed select

- ui_in[2]: Reverse Direction
- ui_in[3]: Red Disable
- ui_in[4]: Green Disable
- ui_in[5]: Blue Disabled
- ui_in[7:6]: not used

## How to test

Simply just tie the relevant pins to toggle the relevant settings

## External hardware

VGA display and connecter will be required.
